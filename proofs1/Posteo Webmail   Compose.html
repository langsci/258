Dear Anna, I am writing from language Science Press, where I am
currently completing an internship. Together with Sebastian N, I have
been in charge of formatting and correcting your book. After the first
round of corrections, we still found some issues and comments that have
remained unaddressed by some of the authors. Some of them concern
choices for the entire book. Could you please send the questions to the
authors of the relevant chapters? Additionally, it would be good to have
a "general response" for the questions concerning the entire book.
Within book: - Sometimes: to appear - Sometimes “forthcoming”. So? -
Same glossing for all: - le = 3sg.dat - to /a = dat - This volume .
change for all CH1 (Cuervo) - Snyder reference missing - dat >> 3sg dat
- fig 2 finish doing - forks misaligned CH 3 - Glossing rules oblique
dative - It’s maria cristina - translations missing in most examples!
please provide thee. CH.8 - kept the reference in Kratzer 2019 with some
of the things as suggested by encyclopaedia itself CH. 11 - Baker 2008
is a book. Took out “parameters of agreement” (that’s a chapter) Ch 14 -
(3) should probably be “contratado” and not “contrato”? - structure in
(5) nit mentioned in running text, should be “telefonía” - v or
\textit{v}? - (10), capital 3 - Table 1: one cell is ,missing [3pl fem]
- page 8, paragraph before example (12): added brackets around
Table1-Table 2 - example (17): RawaN —> Rawan - italics in trees DAT
(replace the gloss of dative 'a' as 'to' to 'DAT' in small caps, here
and in all examples, which are highlighted in yellow.
